# DOTFILES
Those are my personal dotfiles build in Arch Linux, nowadays i'm using i3wm with polybar integrated and a few more details that you can see in this repo

## INSTALLATION(Arch Based)
Here you can find a script to auto install this configuration, you only need to do this:

`python3 script.py`
 
 But if you want you can do it manually, just clone this repo and copy whatever file you want on your 
 .config file (usually is in this directory: **~/.config**)
